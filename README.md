Tri

This should be more or less everything that I've got up for Triangular Logic.

Dependencies
============

SDL2
SDL2_image
SDL2_mixer
SDL2_ttf

In linux you should check your repositories the package names should be close to the following:
Archlinux: sudo pacman -Syu SDL2 SDL2_image SDL2_mixer SDL2_ttf

In Windows I'll include the SDL2 runtime libraries but you may still see complaints about a missing: MSVCP120.dll
That means you need the MS Visual C++ Redistributable Packages for Visual Studio 2013:
